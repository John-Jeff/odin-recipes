        <p>
            Now this one might be a bit difficult to prepare. 
            Something only an Iron Chef would be able to carefully craft.
            But I still think you're fully capable of doing it.
            Cup Noodles. It's a cup...and it's filled with noodles...
            I don't think much more can be said so let's get started!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Go to the store and pick up some Cup Noodles.</li>
            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Rip the lid back to the dotted line.</li>
            <li>Boil water and fill the inside line with the boiling water</li>
            <li>Close the lid and let stand for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir well and burn your mouth because you didn't wait long enough for it to cool down.</li>
        </ol>
